            <p>Fatigue is one of the most common complaints in modern society, yet it's often misunderstood. While many people reach for caffeine or energy drinks, addressing the root causes of fatigue is far more effective for long-term energy optimization.</p>
            
            <h2>Types of Fatigue</h2>
            <p>There are several distinct types of fatigue, each with different causes and solutions:</p>
            
            <h3>Physical Fatigue</h3>
            <p>This type of fatigue affects your muscles and physical performance. Common causes include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inadequate sleep (less than 7 hours)</li>
                <li>Dehydration</li>
                <li>Nutritional deficiencies</li>
                <li>Overexertion without proper recovery</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Mental Fatigue</h3>
            <p>Mental fatigue affects cognitive function, focus, and decision-making. Contributing factors include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prolonged periods of concentration</li>
                <li>Information overload</li>
                <li>Chronic stress</li>
                <li>Poor sleep quality</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Chronic Fatigue</h3>
            <p>When fatigue persists for more than 6 months, it may indicate an underlying condition that requires medical attention.</p>
            
            <h2>Common Causes and Solutions</h2>
            
            <h3>Sleep Issues</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Irregular sleep schedule or poor sleep quality</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Maintain consistent bedtimes, create a dark sleeping environment, and limit screen time before bed.</p>
            
            <h3>Nutritional Factors</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Blood sugar spikes and crashes</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Eat balanced meals with protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates every 3-4 hours.</p>
            
            <h3>Dehydration</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Even mild dehydration can cause fatigue</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Drink water consistently throughout the day, aiming for pale yellow urine.</p>
            
            <h3>Stress</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Chronic stress exhausts the body's energy reserves</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Practice stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or regular exercise.</p>
            
            <h2>When to Seek Medical Help</h2>
            <p>While lifestyle changes can address many fatigue issues, persistent or severe fatigue may indicate underlying health conditions such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anemia (iron deficiency)</li>
                <li>Thyroid disorders</li>
                <li>Sleep apnea</li>
                <li>Chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
                <li>Depression or anxiety</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If lifestyle modifications don't improve your energy levels within 2-3 weeks, consult with a healthcare professional.</p>
