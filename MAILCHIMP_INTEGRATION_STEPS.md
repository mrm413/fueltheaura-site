# 🚀 Mailchimp Integration - Step-by-Step

## Quick Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Mailchimp Account

1. Go to https://mailchimp.com/
2. Click "Sign Up Free"
3. Create your account with your email

### Step 2: Create Your Audience

1. In Mailchimp dashboard, click **"Audience"** → **"Create Audience"**
2. Fill in:
   - **Audience name:** Fuel The Aura Subscribers
   - **Default from email:** your-email@gmail.com (or your domain email)
   - **Default from name:** Fuel The Aura
   - **Reminder:** "You signed up for wellness tips at fueltheaura.com"

### Step 3: Get Your Signup Form Code

1. Go to **Audience** → **Signup forms** → **Embedded forms**
2. Click **"Generate embed code"**
3. You'll see code that looks like this:

```html
<form action="https://fueltheaura.us21.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=abc123&amp;id=xyz789" method="post">
```

4. **Copy the action URL** (the part in quotes after `action=`)

### Step 4: Update Your Website

You need to replace the form action URL in **TWO files**:

#### File 1: `src/_includes/newsletter-form.njk`

Find this line (around line 8):
```html
<form action="#" method="post" class="newsletter-form" id="newsletter-form">
```

Replace `#` with your Mailchimp action URL:
```html
<form action="https://fueltheaura.us21.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=abc123&amp;id=xyz789" method="post" class="newsletter-form" id="newsletter-form">
```

#### File 2: `src/assets/js/newsletter-popup.js`

Find this section (around line 40):
```javascript
// Handle form submission
const form = popup.querySelector('#popup-newsletter-form');
form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    const email = form.querySelector('input[type="email"]').value;
    
    // TODO: Replace with actual Mailchimp submission
```

Replace the entire form submission handler with:
```javascript
// Handle form submission
const form = popup.querySelector('#popup-newsletter-form');
form.setAttribute('action', 'https://fueltheaura.us21.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=abc123&id=xyz789');
form.setAttribute('method', 'post');
form.setAttribute('target', '_blank');

// Add hidden Mailchimp fields
const emailInput = form.querySelector('input[type="email"]');
emailInput.setAttribute('name', 'EMAIL');

// Add honeypot field (prevents spam)
const honeypot = document.createElement('div');
honeypot.style.position = 'absolute';
honeypot.style.left = '-5000px';
honeypot.innerHTML = '<input type="text" name="b_abc123_xyz789" tabindex="-1" value="">';
form.appendChild(honeypot);

form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
    // Let form submit naturally to Mailchimp
    showSuccessMessage(popup);
    
    // Mark as subscribed
    localStorage.setItem('newsletter_subscribed', 'true');
    
    // Close popup after 2 seconds
    setTimeout(closePopup, 2000);
});
```

**Important:** Replace `abc123` and `xyz789` with your actual Mailchimp IDs from the action URL!

### Step 5: Set Up Weekly Newsletter

#### Option A: Automated RSS-to-Email (Recommended)

1. In Mailchimp, go to **Campaigns** → **Create Campaign**
2. Choose **Email** → **RSS Campaign**
3. Configure:
   - **RSS feed URL:** `https://fueltheaura.com/feed.xml`
   - **Send frequency:** Weekly
   - **Day:** Tuesday
   - **Time:** 10:00 AM (or vary each week)
   - **Subject:** "This Week's Wellness Insights from Fuel The Aura"

4. Design your template:
   - Click **"Design Email"**
   - Choose a template
   - Add your logo
   - Customize colors to match your brand
   - Add social media links

#### Option B: Manual Weekly Newsletter

1. Create a **Regular Campaign** instead
2. Schedule it for every Tuesday
3. Manually add content each week

### Step 6: Create Welcome Email (Automation)

1. Go to **Automations** → **Create** → **Welcome new subscribers**
2. Set trigger: **When someone subscribes**
3. Design welcome email:

**Subject:** "Welcome to Fuel The Aura! ⚡"

**Content:**
```
