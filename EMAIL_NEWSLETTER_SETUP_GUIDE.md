## 🎲 Random Timing Strategy

### Why Random Timing Works:
- ✅ Creates anticipation ("When will this week's email arrive?")
- ✅ Reduces predictability (less likely to be ignored)
- ✅ Higher open rates (catches people at different times)
- ✅ Feels more personal and less automated

### Recommended Schedule:

**Week 1:** Tuesday, 9:00 AM EST  
**Week 2:** Tuesday, 2:00 PM EST  
**Week 3:** Tuesday, 11:00 AM EST  
**Week 4:** Tuesday, 4:00 PM EST  
**Week 5:** Tuesday, 10:30 AM EST  

**Always Tuesday** (consistency) but **different times** (randomness)
