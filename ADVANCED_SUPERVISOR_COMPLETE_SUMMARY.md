## 🎯 Configuration Options

### Adjust Supervision Frequency:
Edit `/opt/fueltheaura-ai/advanced_supervisor_ai.py`:
```python
# Line ~750 - Change from 6 hours to desired interval
time.sleep(6 * 60 * 60)  # 6 hours

# Examples:
time.sleep(3 * 60 * 60)   # 3 hours (more frequent)
time.sleep(12 * 60 * 60)  # 12 hours (less frequent)
```

### Customize Auto-Improvements:
```python
# Add new auto-fix rules in implement_auto_improvements()
# Example: Auto-fix broken links
def fix_broken_links(self):
    # Your custom logic here
    pass
```

### Set Impact Score Thresholds:
```python
# Only log high-impact improvements
if impact_score >= 0.8:
    self.log_improvement(...)
```
