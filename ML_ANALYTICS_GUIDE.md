## 📈 How It Works

### Data Collection
The ML system collects data from:
- Improvement history (supervisor_improvements.db)
- SEO metrics (seo_metrics table)
- Content quality scores (content_intelligence.db)
- Audit results (audits/*.json)
- System metrics (supervisor_reports/*.json)

### Model Training
1. **Data Loading:** Aggregates historical data from all sources
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracts time-based and categorical features
3. **Model Training:** Trains multiple ML models on historical patterns
4. **Validation:** Tests models on held-out data
5. **Performance Tracking:** Logs accuracy, RMSE, and R² scores

### Prediction Generation
1. **Daily Predictions:** Generates predictions every 24 hours
2. **Multiple Horizons:** Short-term (7 days) and long-term (30 days)
3. **Confidence Scores:** Each prediction includes confidence level
4. **Database Storage:** All predictions saved for tracking accuracy

### Insight Discovery
1. **Pattern Recognition:** Identifies trends and patterns
2. **Anomaly Detection:** Flags unusual behavior
3. **Recommendation Engine:** Generates actionable insights
4. **Priority Ranking:** Orders insights by impact and confidence

## 📊 Understanding Predictions

### Improvement Impact Predictions

**Format:**
```json
{
  "date": "2024-01-15",
  "category": "seo",
  "predicted_impact": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.75
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- `predicted_impact`: Expected impact score (0.0 - 1.0)
  - 0.0-0.3: Low impact
  - 0.3-0.7: Medium impact
  - 0.7-1.0: High impact
- `confidence`: Model confidence (0.0 - 1.0)
  - 0.0-0.5: Low confidence
  - 0.5-0.8: Medium confidence
  - 0.8-1.0: High confidence

### Content Quality Predictions

**Format:**
```json
{
  "word_count": 2000,
  "predicted_high_quality": true,
  "confidence": 0.82
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- `predicted_high_quality`: true = likely high quality (>0.7 score)
- `confidence`: Probability of correct prediction

### Traffic Trend Predictions

**Format:**
```json
{
  "date": "2024-01-15",
  "predicted_traffic_index": 45.2,
  "day_of_week": "Monday"
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- `predicted_traffic_index`: Relative traffic score
  - Higher values = more traffic expected
  - Compare across days to see trends
  - Not absolute visitor numbers

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ML Service Won't Start

```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status ml-analytics.service

# View error logs
journalctl -u ml-analytics.service -n 50

# Common issues:
# 1. Missing dependencies
source /opt/fueltheaura-ai/ai-venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy

# 2. Insufficient data
# Need at least 30-50 data points for training
# Wait for more data to accumulate

# 3. Database locked
# Stop service, wait 10 seconds, restart
systemctl stop ml-analytics.service
sleep 10
systemctl start ml-analytics.service
```

### Insufficient Training Data

```bash
# Check data availability
sqlite3 /opt/fueltheaura-ai/data/supervisor_improvements.db << EOF
SELECT COUNT(*) as improvement_count FROM improvements;
EOF

sqlite3 /opt/fueltheaura-ai/data/content_intelligence.db << EOF
SELECT COUNT(*) as content_count FROM blog_posts;
EOF

# Need minimum:
# - 50+ improvements for improvement predictor
# - 30+ blog posts for content predictor
# - 30+ days of data for traffic predictor
```

### Low Model Accuracy

```bash
# Check model performance
sqlite3 /opt/fueltheaura-ai/data/ml_predictions.db << EOF
SELECT model_name, accuracy, training_samples 
FROM model_performance 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
EOF

# If accuracy is low:
# 1. Wait for more data (models improve with more samples)
# 2. Check data quality
# 3. Retrain models after accumulating more data
```

### Predictions Not Updating

```bash
# Check when last prediction was made
sqlite3 /opt/fueltheaura-ai/data/ml_predictions.db << EOF
SELECT MAX(timestamp) as last_prediction FROM predictions;
EOF

# Check service uptime
systemctl status ml-analytics.service | grep Active

# Restart service if needed
systemctl restart ml-analytics.service
```
